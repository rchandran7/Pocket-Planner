# PocketPlanner
## Description
The Pocket Planner is an all in one scheduling app for mobile iOS and Android devices. This app will primarily be formatted to students needs, but will be easily scalable to be used by anyone. The user will be able to seamlessly add course schedules, assignments, reminders, deadlines, and whatever else the user deems necessary to have in their schedule. The apps that currently exist in this space are difficult to use and not worth the time it takes to set up, especially as your schedule evolves from quarter to quarter as a student. This project is significant because it will streamline the issues the existing scheduling apps currently have and make the lives of our users more manageable and organized.

## Tools
React Native, AWS Amplify, GraphQL, Android Studio, iOS Simulator, Expo Go

## Final Vision
Our final vision for the app will be an app available through Google Play Store and App Store for iOS users, that organizes and assists the users with their scheduling needs.
